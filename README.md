# Car Dealer - Hash Tables
### Worked while taking the CIIC4020 (Data Structures) course at UPRM, Fall 2019.

The assignment consisted of understanding the design and implementation of List ADT using Hash Tables, and understanding client server programming using REST and JSON. The students were tasked with building a REST API with CRUD operations to simulate a Car Dealer system, utilizing Hash Tables.
